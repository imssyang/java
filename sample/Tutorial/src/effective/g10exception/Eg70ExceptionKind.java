 * Item 70: Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and
 *          runtime exceptions for programming errors
 *   - Java provides three kinds of throwables: checked exceptions, runtime exceptions, and errors.
 *   - Use checked exceptions for conditions from which the caller can reasonably be expected to recover.
 *   - Use runtime exceptions to indicate programming errors.
 *   - All of the unchecked throwables you implement should subclass RuntimeException.
