/**
 * Item 82: Document thread safety
 *   - Immutable: Instances of this class appear constant. No external synchronization is necessary.
 *                eg String, Long, and BigInteger.
 *   - Unconditionally thread-safe: Instances of this class are mutable, but the class has sufficient
 *                                  internal synchronization that its instances can be used concurrently
 *                                  without the need for any external synchronization.
 *                                  eg AtomicLong and ConcurrentHashMap.
 *   - Conditionally thread-safe: Like unconditionally thread-safe, except that some methods require
 *                                external synchronization for safe concurrent use.
 *                                eg  Collections.synchronized wrappers.
 *   - Not thread-safe: Instances of this class are mutable. each method invocation (or invocation sequence)
 *                      with external synchronization.
 *                      eg ArrayList and HashMap.
 *   - Thread-hostile: This class is unsafe for concurrent use even if every method invocation is surrounded
 *                     by external synchronization.
