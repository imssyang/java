/**
 * A properly constructed object can be safely published by:
 *   - x Initializing an object reference from a static initializer;
 *   - x Storing a reference to it into a volatile field or AtomicReference;
 *   - x Storing a reference to it into a final field of a properly constructed object;
 *   - x Storing a reference to it into a field that is properly guarded by a lock.
 *
 * The threadÍ²safe library collections offer the following safe publication guarantees,
 * even if the Javadoc is less than clear on the subject:
 *   - x Placing a key or value in a Hashtable, synchronizedMap, or Concurrent-Map safely publishes it to any thread
 *     that retrieves it from the Map (whether directly or via an iterator);
 *   - x Placing an element in a Vector, CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWrite-ArraySet, synchronizedList, or
 *     synchronizedSet safely publishes it to any thread that retrieves it from the collection;
 *   - x Placing an element on a BlockingQueue or a ConcurrentLinkedQueue safely publishes it to any thread that
 *     retrieves it from the queue.
