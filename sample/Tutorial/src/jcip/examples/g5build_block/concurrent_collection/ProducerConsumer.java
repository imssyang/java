/**
 * ConcurrentHashMap, a replacement for synchronized hashÍ²based Map implementations, and CopyOnWriteArrayList, a
 * replacement for synchronized List implementations for cases where traversal is the dominant operation.
 *
 * Queue is intended to hold a set of elements temporarily while they await processing. Queue operations do not block;
 * if the queue is empty, the retrieval operation returns null. Several implementations:
 *   - ConcurrentLinkedQueue, a traditional FIFO queue.
 *   - PriorityQueue, a (non concurrent) priority ordered queue.
 *
 * Blocking queues provide blocking put and take methods as well as the timed equivalents offer and poll. If the queue
 * is full, put blocks until space becomes available; if the queue is empty, take blocks until an element is available.
 * Blocking queues support the producer-consumer design pattern, the class library contains several implementations:
 *   - LinkedBlockingQueue and ArrayBlockingQueue are FIFO queues, analogous to LinkedList and ArrayList but with
 *     better concurrent performance than a synchronized List.
 *   - PriorityBlockingQueue is a priority-ordered queue, which is useful when you want to process elements in an
 *     order other than FIFO. Just like other sorted collections, PriorityBlockingQueue can compare elements according to
 *     their natural order (if they implement Comparable) or using a Comparator.
 *   - SynchronousQueue is not really a queue at all, in that it maintains no storage space for queued elements.
 *     Instead, it maintains a list of queued threads waiting to enqueue or dequeue an element. since a SynchronousQueue
 *     has no storage capacity, put and take will block unless another thread is already waiting to participate in the handoff.
 *     Synchronous queues are generally suitable only when there are enough consumers that there nearly always will be
 *     one ready to take the handoff.
 *
 * Deque is a double-ended queue that allows efficient insertion and removal from both the head and the tail.
 * Implementations include:
 *   - ArrayDeque.
 *   - LinkedBlockingDeque.
