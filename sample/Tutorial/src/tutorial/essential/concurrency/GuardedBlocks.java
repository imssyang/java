/**
 * Guarded Block:
 *   Threads often have to coordinate their actions. The most common coordination idiom is the guarded block.
 *   Such a block begins by polling a condition that must be true before the block can proceed.
 *   There are a number of steps to follow in order to do this correctly.
 *
 * Example:
 *   public synchronized void guardedJoy() {
 *       // This guard only loops once for each special event, which may not be the event we're waiting for.
 *       while(!joy) {
 *           try {
 *               wait();
 *           } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
 *       }
 *       System.out.println("Joy and efficiency have been achieved!");
 *   }
 *
 *   public synchronized notifyJoy() {
 *       joy = true;
 *       notifyAll();
 *   }
 *
 * Note:
 *   1. When a thread invokes d.wait, it must own the intrinsic lock for d â€” otherwise an error is thrown.
 *      Invoking wait inside a synchronized method is a simple way to acquire the intrinsic lock.
 *   2. When wait is invoked, the thread releases the lock and suspends execution.
 *   3. At some future time, another thread will acquire the same lock and invoke Object.notifyAll,
 *      informing all threads waiting on that lock
