/**
 * Immutable Objects:
 *   An object is considered immutable if its state cannot change after it is constructed.
 *   Maximum reliance on immutable objects is widely accepted as a sound strategy for creating simple, reliable code.
 *
 * Note:
 *   Programmers are often reluctant to employ immutable objects, because they worry about the cost of creating a new object as opposed to updating an object in place.
 *   The impact of object creation is often overestimated, and can be offset by some of the efficiencies associated with immutable objects.
 *   These include decreased overhead due to garbage collection, and the elimination of code needed to protect mutable objects from corruption.

     * The following rules define a simple strategy for creating immutable objects:
     *   1. Don't provide "setter" methods â€” methods that modify fields or objects referred to by fields.
     *   2. Make all fields final and private.
     *   3. Don't allow subclasses to override methods.
     *      The simplest way to do this is to declare the class as final.
     *      A more sophisticated approach is to make the constructor private and construct instances in factory methods.
     *   4. If the instance fields include references to mutable objects, don't allow those objects to be changed:
     *      a) Don't provide methods that modify the mutable objects.
     *      b) Don't share references to the mutable objects.
     *         Never store references to external, mutable objects passed to the constructor;
     *         if necessary, create copies, and store references to the copies.
     *         Similarly, create copies of your internal mutable objects when necessary to avoid returning the originals in your methods.
