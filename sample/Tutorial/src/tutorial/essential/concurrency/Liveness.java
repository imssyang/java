     * Livelock Comparable Example:
     *   This is comparable to two people attempting to pass each other in a corridor:
     *   Alphonse moves to his left to let Gaston pass, while Gaston moves to his right to let Alphonse pass.
     *   Seeing that they are still blocking each other, Alphone moves to his right, while Gaston moves to his left.
     *   They're still blocking each other, so...

     *   For example,
     *     1. Suppose an object provides a synchronized method that often takes a long time to return.
     *     2. If one thread invokes this method frequently, other threads that also need frequent synchronized access to the same object will often be blocked.
